                    you to plummet down the highest part of the cliff. You black out when you hit the ground.. well... because your dead.

                    behind you and realize you have been spotted! Next you hear gun shots, but you trip over a
                    trap that rips into your upper leg. You crash to the ground, wondering what has happened
                    that farmers need such big traps! You lose consiousness and bleed out before the crazy farmers reach your body.

                    running away from you. The sheriff draws his weapon and he asks where you came from, and of course you reply,
                    "From the woods", the sheriff shakes his head. "No one survives in the woods, and if they do, they dont live very long."
                    he says, before shooting you. As you fall you see your reflection in a puddle, you body has mutated from the teleporter, and your skin was a sick shade of green.
